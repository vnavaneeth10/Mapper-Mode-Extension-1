Controlled Queue Loader does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

All data used by the extension (such as URL queue state, task progress, and user preferences) is stored locally on the user's device using chrome.storage.local. This data never leaves the user's browser and is not transmitted to any external servers.

The extension does not use analytics, tracking, cookies, remote code, or third-party services of any kind.

Data is used only to provide the core functionality of the extension and is removed when the extension is uninstalled.
